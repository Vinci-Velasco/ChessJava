# ChessJava
Hi my name is Vinci Velasco and i'm a 2nd year Software Systems student at SFU!
This is a personal project of mine to apply newly learnt skills of OOP. 

**About This Project:**
- A game of chess that can be played among 2 players on the command line.
- Ability to move pieces, update the board, and determine winners through checkmate.
- Includes draw and en passant functionality.
- Utilizes OOP principles learnt over the previous semester

**Extending the Project**
- Use a GUI instead of on the command line
- Show turn history in chess notation, and display the pieces that have been
  previously captured.
- Add additional menus (start, help, etc.)
- Add ability to play 1 player with an AI!
